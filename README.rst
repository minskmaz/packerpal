==========================
PACKERPAL
==========================

Where subprocess pipes play nice and with packer build's (verbose) stdout/stderr stream

Requirements:

* 10 minutes (read the code)
* 1 minute (set 8 variables)
* 4 minutes (your docker image(s) is/are ready)

you will need to write one little order.json file looks like this:

['my_packer_file.json', 'some_other_packer_file.json']

you'll see what it's for.
